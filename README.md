## FYI

Worth to mention that I'm not using a state managment tool because it was not needed. I would use context fopr session maybe, and probably zustand as main state management!

First of all you need to have nodejs installed. So, if you don't have it, install with you package manager or download it from [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install.

Now that you have nodejs installed, you need to clone this project into your device `https://github.com/carlosberti/jobsonthego.git`.
